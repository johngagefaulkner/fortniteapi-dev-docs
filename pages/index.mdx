# FortniteAPI.dev

## What is FortniteAPI.dev?

An API that provides developers with ready-to-use content that's easily accessible to enable quick bootstrapping of new projects. For example, rather than figuring out where all the string resources are stored in the game's files, then building your own database of localized strings, make a simple `GET` request to `https://prod.fortniteapi.dev/v1/strings/{GUID}` and you'll receive a `JSON` response containing the human-readable strings in each of the supported languages. 

Only want to translate a GUID to a specific language? Easy! Simply add your language identifier to your API request. For example: `https://prod.fortniteapi.dev/v1/strings/{GUID}/en-US` ðŸ˜Š
